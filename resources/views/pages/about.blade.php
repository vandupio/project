<p>As huge fan of the Filipino way of cooking, it is my goal to teach people how to cook Filipino dishes  using the simplest way possible.
</p><p>
Aside for my deep passion in cooking and my continuous craving for the distinctive Filipino taste, I was motivated to create cooking videos in order to promote Filipino food.  I noticed that Filipino Cuisine is not well represented outside of the Philippines. It is time for our food to be noticed, known, tasted, and enjoyed by the rest of the world.
